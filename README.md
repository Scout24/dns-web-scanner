dns-web-scanner
===============


This project is DEPRECATED and not any longer supported
=======================================================

Scan a list of DNS domains for active HTTP services and redirects. Example:

```
$ ./dns_web_scanner.py schapiro.org www.schapiro.org schapiro.bad
http://schapiro.org/ OK
 ADDRESS 216.239.34.21 216.239.36.21 216.239.38.21 216.239.32.21
 REDIRECT 301 http://www.schapiro.org/
http://www.schapiro.org/ OK
 ALIAS ghs.google.com
 ADDRESS 173.194.65.121
http://schapiro.bad/ BAD
 RESOLVED NODATA schapiro.bad
```

We use it to make sure that our numerous DNS domains point to something useful.

Requires `python-cheetah` and `python-adns`.

Usage:
------

```
$ ./dns_web_scanner.py --help
usage: dns_web_scanner.py [-h] [-V] [-v] [-H | -C] [-w] [-o FILE]
                          TARGET [TARGET ...]

Read DNS names or URLs from CSV files or command line. The name will be checked for
a valid DNS response (CNAME or A) and a working web server on port 80. HTTP
and (I)FRAME redirects will be followed and checked.

(I)FRAME redirects is something we want to get rid off, so they count as an error.

CSV files are ;-separated and the first line (headers) is skipped. Only the first element
from the CSV file is used and should be a host or URL without the http:// prefix.
